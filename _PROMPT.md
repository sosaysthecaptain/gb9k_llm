Tell me about the context you received.


### LLM
Certainly! I have received the contents of four files related to a Node.js project. Here are the files and their key purposes:

1. **README.md**: This file is provided but currently empty; it's typically intended for documentation about the project.

2. **main.js**: This is the main script file for a command-line tool called "gb9k". It processes commands such as copying code to the clipboard, cleaning up temporary files, running a user prompt over OpenRouter, setting an API key, and managing file output. It handles arguments for different commands and provides usage information.

3. **package.json**: This file contains metadata about the Node.js package "gb9k", including its name, version, description, and dependencies like "clipboardy" and "node-fetch". It also specifies that the package is a module and includes scripts for starting the application.

4. **utils.js**: This utility file includes functions for handling API keys, prompting users for information, and fetching code files from directories. It manages configuration directories and file reading/writing, with helper functions related to file management and user interaction.

If you need further modifications or explanations, feel free to ask!
